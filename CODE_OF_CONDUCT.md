# Internal Code of Professional Conduct - SAM_AUTO

## Overview

This project is an internal resource for **Sampark/AEPL**. Our goal is to maintain a professional, collaborative, and respectful environment for all team members involved in automation development.

## Professional Standards

We expect all internal contributors to adhere to the following standards:

1.  **Professional Communication**: Ensure all comments in code, Jira tickets, and communication channels (Slack/Teams) are professional and respectful.
2.  **Collaborative Spirit**: Support team members during code reviews and knowledge sharing. Constructive criticism should be focused on the code, not the individual.
3.  **Data Privacy & Security**: Since this project handles internal automation, always adhere to AEPL's data security policies. Never commit sensitive credentials or PII (Personally Identifiable Information) to the repository.
4.  **Integrity**: Be honest about progress and challenges. If a bug or automation failure is discovered, focus on the solution rather than assigning blame.
5.  **Inclusivity**: Respect the diverse backgrounds, skills, and perspectives of all team members.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered a violation of internal professional standards:

*   Harassment or discrimination of any kind.
*   The use of inappropriate or offensive language in commit messages or documentation.
*   Unprofessional conduct during team meetings or code reviews.
*   Intentional circumvention of security audit or quality standards.

## Reporting & Resolution

If you experience or witness behavior that violates these professional standards, please follow the established internal reporting lines:

1.  **Project Lead**: In many cases, issues can be resolved through a direct conversation with the Project Lead.
2.  **Management**: If the issue is with a lead or remains unresolved, escalate to the appropriate Engineering Manager.
3.  **Human Resources**: For serious violations involving harassment or discrimination, please refer to the AEPL Employee Handbook for HR reporting procedures.
